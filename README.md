# Real Time Banking-Transaction-System

## Description
Traditional online banking applications are currently experiencing great competition from new players in the market who are offering direct transactions with a few seconds of response time. Banks are therefore looking at possibilities of changing their traditional method which involves batch transactions at given times of the day with hours in between.

They must now update their software to adapt to the current demand, which means transactions must be handled in real-time. This project implements features of a simplified and scaled down real-time banking transaction system.
